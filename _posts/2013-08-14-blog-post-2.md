Under the backdrop of an aging population, the rise of intelligent capital may not necessarily be a bad thing. The mechanism of intelligent substitution for labor can have an impact on the workforce. In the context of an aging population, gender-wise, there is a significant positive effect on the employment rate for those with higher education backgrounds, while the impact on males with lower education is relatively small, and the impact on females with lower education is relatively larger. However, the development of intelligence does indeed lead to an increase in labor productivity, which to some extent promotes social production. Nevertheless, the use of automated labor productivity has had a negative impact on the labor income share, which is inconsistent with the policy goal of increasing residents' income levels. Therefore, society should not focus solely on the development of intelligent machines but should reasonably allocate labor shares. In addition, while strengthening education, we must be cautious of the "education trap," focusing not only on obtaining a degree but also on improving professional skills and general quality.

老龄化背景下，智能化资本的崛起是否是一件坏事？智能代替劳动的机制对劳动力产生影响。老龄化前提下，就性别来讲，对高等教育背景就业率有显著正向影响，对低等教育男性影响较小，对低等教育女性影响偏大（女性由于生理结构问题，对于低等教育女性的首选大多数工种集中在：流水线女工，清洁等，随着工厂机器智能化发展，大多数流水线工种被机器人取代；男性由于体力优势，可选择一些目前无法用机器替代的体力工作），这也成为性工作者和代孕等违法行为暴增的一部分，因为工作选择的减少。然而，智能化的发展的确会带来劳动生产率的提升，一定程度上促进了社会生产，然而，自动化劳动生产率的使用对劳动收入份额产生了负面影响，这与提高居民收入水平的政策目标不一致，因此，社会上不能一味的以发展智能机器为主，而要合理分配劳动份额，除此以外，学历加强的同时要小心“学历陷阱”不能只关注于学历的获得，而要着重专业技能和通识素质的提升。
