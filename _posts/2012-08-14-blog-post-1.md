In rural China, the aging population and evolving family structures are challenging the traditional 'feedback model' of intergenerational support. This is particularly evident in the plight of widowed seniors, who face heightened old-age care concerns. Amidst these shifts, a notable phenomenon has emerged: widowed elders securing their elderly care needs through remarriage, signifying a strategic response to potential familial neglect.

This marital recourse for elderly care reflects a realignment of familial care responsibilities, coinciding with a power shift from elder to younger generations. While this adaptation is crucial for establishing new rural elderly care paradigms, it disproportionately affects those with limited resources, particularly older women, potentially exacerbating their vulnerabilities.
