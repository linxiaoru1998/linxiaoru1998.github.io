In traditional Chinese society, the family operates on a "feedback model" of intergenerational support, wherein generation A nurtures generation B, generation B in turn supports generation A, while nurturing generation C, and so forth. However, this reciprocal structure is increasingly being challenged by demographic shifts, particularly in the context of rural China, where population aging and evolving family dynamics have put pressure on the conventional model of elderly care. A critical issue within this framework is the care of widowed elderly individuals, who often find themselves facing the dual burdens of social isolation and economic insecurity. In response, some elderly have turned to what is referred to as "old age through marriage," seeking to address their old-age care needs via formal or informal remarriage.

The redistribution of elderly care responsibilities within the family has been shaped by the broader shift from a patriarchal model of authority to one where offspring, particularly adult children, hold greater decision-making power. This shift, exacerbated by the aging population, has weakened the traditional elder-centered authority in the family structure, necessitating alternative strategies for elderly care. Widowed elderly, in particular, increasingly view remarriage as a form of self-preservation, as it provides a means to mitigate potential neglect by their offspring and address unmet emotional, financial, and caregiving needs.

Although the bloodline-based caregiving model remains dominant, the advent of China’s one-child policy has significantly undermined the traditional model of "child-rearing for old-age support." This has led to an increasing reliance on a "daughter-rearing" model, where daughters, rather than sons, are often seen as the primary caregivers for elderly parents. Despite this shift, many elderly parents prefer to live independently, relying on financial support from their children without cohabitation. Even in cases where parents live with their children, they are frequently marginalized, lacking authority over family resources or decision-making. This sense of disenfranchisement, coupled with the psychological effects of prolonged loneliness and the economic strain of funding their own old age, drives some elderly individuals to seek companionship and care through remarriage.

Remarriage among the elderly differs from that of younger individuals, with practical considerations often outweighing emotional or romantic factors. While emotional companionship and physical needs remain important, elderly remarriage is frequently framed as a transactional arrangement, wherein resources, caregiving responsibilities, and household roles are negotiated. Gender and regional disparities further complicate these dynamics. For example, elderly men may seek remarriage as a means of exchanging economic resources for caregiving from a female partner, while elderly women may enter into such marriages to secure emotional and physical care, despite significant risks related to financial dependency and health vulnerabilities.

From the perspective of the elderly, remarriage can be seen as a strategic response to shifting family politics, particularly the erosion of their authority and control over family resources. It functions as a form of "self-help," enabling the elderly to reassert some control over their care in the absence of reliable familial support. However, while remarriage may offer a temporary solution to the challenges of old age, it is not without its limitations. This model is particularly precarious for resource-poor elderly individuals and elderly women, who may face heightened risks of economic exploitation, social marginalization, and health-related vulnerabilities within remarriage arrangements. Consequently, while "old age through marriage" serves as an adaptive response to the pressures of population aging and familial change, it also underscores the need for broader, more sustainable solutions to the challenges of elderly care in rural China.

中国社会是“反馈模式”，即“甲代抚育乙代、乙代赡养甲代、乙代抚育丙代、丙代又赡养乙代，下一代对上一代都要反馈。然而随着年轻一代对家庭的选择多样化，中国农村地区面临人口老龄化的挑战，传统的家庭养老模式受到冲击，丧偶老年人的养老问题尤为突出。通过婚姻的养老的现象，即丧偶老年人通过正式或非正式的婚姻方式来实现养老目标。
养老责任分配进行的互动，以及家庭政治从父代主导型向子代主导型的转变导致人口老龄化导致家庭内部养老责任重新分配，丧偶老年人通过再婚行为进行“养老自救”，以应对子代可能的弃养现象。
虽然血缘养亲的模式依然为主旋律，但是由于独生子女政策，传统的“依儿养老”模式无法完全依赖，“依女养老”的模式也成为主要养老模式，然而大部分养老模式都以子女提供养老费用，而父母通常选择独自居住或者居住在养老院，即使和子女同住，同样会被剥夺对家庭内部资源和权威的支配权力丧失。长期独自居住的“孤独感”以及“无价值感”或者自身养老资源的匮乏推动了“婚姻养老”的模式。老年婚姻和青年婚姻存在相同和不同点，相同点集中于情感和生理层面，不同点主要集中于资源分配，作用层面。老龄养老的功能也存在性别，地区等的差异。如老龄男性的婚姻需求主要是通过经济资源和女性老年人的生活照料的共享和互换），而女性主要是以照顾生活换取养老的模式，这种方式面临着经济、健康等巨大风险。但从养老角度来看，老年人的婚姻选择更多的是一场为应付家庭权力的分割过程中的一场“自救”行动。
这种养老方式的兴起对农村养老秩序构建具有重要意义，但同时也存在局限性，特别是对于资源匮乏的老年人和老年女性，可能面临更大的风险。
